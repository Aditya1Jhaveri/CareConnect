# CareConnect

CareConnect is a web application that allows patients to schedule appointments with doctors at a clinic. The application is built using ReactJS for the frontend, and uses a Spring Boot backend with a MySQL database. The application also includes email verification, which is used to confirm doctor approval and appointment booking.


## Getting Started
To get started with the application, clone the repository to your local machine:

https://github.com/Aditya1Jhaveri/CareConnect.git

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd Front-end
npm install
```

Finally, start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000
## Backend
The CareConnect backend is built using Spring Boot, and uses a MySQL database to store the application data. To run the backend, follow these steps:

1 Install MySQL and create a new database called careconnect.

2 Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file and replace the spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password properties with your MySQL username and password.

3 Navigate to the backend directory and run ./mvnw spring-boot:run to start the backend server.

The backend API should now be accessible at http://localhost:8080/api.
## Email Verification

CareConnect uses email verification to confirm doctor approval and appointment booking. When a doctor signs up for the application, an email is sent to the clinic administrator to confirm the doctor's approval. When a patient schedules an appointment, an email is sent to the patient to confirm the appointment booking.
